So, I wanted to create hook library similar to kthook.  
The goal is to make multi-purpose hooking library with simple template interface.  

Current roadmap:
- [X] Functions hooks
- [ ] Class methods hooks
- [ ] Class constructors/destructors hooks
- [ ] Naked hooks (hook at any place where you want)
- [ ] VMT hooks
- [ ] Simple call hooks
  
At this time, you can build this project only in 32-bit mode with MSVC on Windows.  
I'm really don't like how it's implimented, but I'm too tired to make it better.
